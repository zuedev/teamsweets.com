# teamsweets.com Public Gallery

This is the public gallery for teamsweets.com, where you can find various images and media shared by Sweets to be showcased.

## How does it work?

The gallery's structure is designed to be iterated over by the frontend, whilst allowing for easy addition of new images. The structure is as follows:

`gallery/category/artist_name/filename.ext`

- **gallery:** The root directory for all gallery images.
- **category:** A subdirectory for each category of images (e.g., "art", "photography", etc.).
- **artist_name:** A subdirectory for each artist or creator to be credited for their work.
- **filename.ext:** The actual image file, which can be in formats like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.
